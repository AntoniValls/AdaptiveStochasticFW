# AdaptiveStochasticFW
We delve into two foundational papers: Reddi et. al.’s Stochastic Frank-Wolfe algorithm (SFW) and Combettes et. al.’s AdaSVRF. Our computational experiments, using Iris and Obesity datasets, demonstrate AdaSVRF’s superior performance over SFW, leveraging AdaGrad’s adaptive learning rates and variance reduction.
